      <Details>The aliens of this space-time have a fairly predictable pattern of speech. Other than the robotic race, these races communicate by moving flesh on their faces that are connected to an organ that can manipulate the flow of air which produces noise.||With this in mind, we have created the means for us to understand and communicate with them.</Details>

      <Details>Every species we have encountered in this reality governs themselves differently.   Although we have made many adjustments to living in this dimension,  we have not yet examined our own structures in this area.   We now have the computing power to run governing simulations. As a starting point we shall simulate the attitudes and priorities of the most common alien political groups.</Details>

    <Culture ID="StarRep">
      <DisplayName>Virtual Republic</DisplayName>
      <Description>Allows us to implement an artificial republic.</Description>
      <Details>Alpha builds of our simulated republic have suggested that discrete, generalized external input is essential for optimal  performance.   With this in mind,  we have opened the project up to the general public,  who can now vote to determine which of the simulated parties they want to be in charge of planetary management.  Our project scientists know best,  of course,  but the feedback from the whole will be invaluable.  The simulation does have some interesting negative performance cases if disagreement reaches critical levels,  but this is unlikely to happen.</Details>

    <Culture ID="StarDem">
      <DisplayName>Virtual Democracy</DisplayName>
      <Description>Allows us to implement an artificial democracy.</Description>
      <Details>The Republic Simulation has been an unqualified success.   Though the primitive species of this space-time have evolved their systems over many generations of trial and error,  adjusting slowly to cultural and external changes,  we are limited only by computing power.   Never satisfied,  our scientists have been running  more simulations,  including those with more varied external feedback parameters,  inspired by other species' so-called "Democracies".   One of these has shown enough promise to take into beta,  so we have upgraded the live project and trained the general populace with the new usage parameters.   Early results seem promising.</Details>

      <DisplayName>Virtual Federation</DisplayName>
      <Description>Allows us to implement an artificial federation.</Description>
      <Details>Refining the Democracy Simulation has proven to be a bigger task than we anticipated.   Our scientists have postulated  a theoretical upper performance limit in this space-time,  and that we shall soon reach a point where attempting to fix errors in the system will,  on average,  cause more.   One of our scientists purchased a "hyper advanced probability generating matrix" from a Terran trader,  who claimed it was so advanced it could simulate our simulations,  but it crashed.   So it seems we are at the end of this road.||Pleasingly,  the Terran system was not a total loss.  The crashed system emits a lovely blue glow,  so we donated it to an artisan.  He had it encased in glassteel panels and framed in beveled titanium.  Quite pretty.  He calls the piece "Windows",  a clever reference to the enclosed light and inverted dimensionality.||The few Terrans that have seen the piece find it uproariously amusing,  which is puzzling.  Hyperdimensional humor is usually lost on other species.</Details>

      <Description>Allows us to begin building infrastructure on other planets.</Description>
      <Details>The logistical underpinnings of our civilization were based on a premise that does not exist in this space-time. That premise is cheap, nearly unlimited energy. The Apocalypse that originates in this space-time in their near future does not reach our space-time for a considerable amount of time. As a result, we have developed energy sources that are far beyond anything that is present here.||Unfortunately, the Hyperion Matrix we brought with us, the source of our advanced technology, is all based on what would be called "Expert Gravitronics". This is a technology that simply does not exist in any form and would require decades for us to re-invent. As a result, we have to make use of portable fusion reactors that we buy on the open market or manufacture ourselves.||Stellar Production is the adaptation of our tools for technological and manufacturing production to use fusion reactors as opposed to Gravitronic Reactors. The side-effect is that while our production will be far beyond what anyone else is capable of, the maintenance of our systems will be an order of magnitude greater as well.</Details>
