      <Description>Research into specialized slavelings.</Description>
      <Details>For hundreds of years, the [YOURSHORTCIVNAME] have used genetic engineering to improve our workforce. One of our biggest challenges has been something of a paradox. For economic planning, we need slaves that are smart enough to understand the nuances of interstellar commerce, but not smart enough to start rebellions.||One of our scientists has recently made a proposal; if we mix our own genome with that of a dumb but naturally empathic slave species, we might get a hybrid smart enough to be put to use in the business sector, but so attuned to the happiness of others that the mere thought of deliberately causing chaos and destruction would be unbearably painful. Using our own pure genome in such a way is heresy, of course, and the scientist and his team have already been sentenced to the Arena.||Mind you, that doesn't mean we're going to ignore this promising idea. Oh, and here's your tickets for tonight's fight, enjoy!</Details>

      <DisplayName>Administrative Slavelings</DisplayName>
      <Description>Improving our economy whether they like it or not.</Description>
      <Details>We did it! The first generation of administrative slavelings is already at work on our budget. There seems to be some natural variation in the slavelings' approaches, so we've segregated them into several groups. To mock other races of the galaxy, we named these slave groups after prominent political parties of their governments. Even more amusing, they have come to think that you, [YOURLEADERNAME], are having a change of heart and want to bring more equality to [YOUREMPIRENAME]! Seriously - there is no end to the comedy here - we're even thinking of setting up mock 'elections'!||Unfortunately, there is a small downside to the empathic nature of these slavelings. If they are around too many unhappy people, if throws them off their game and they start making costly mistakes. So we kind of have to keep our own people happy to keep them reliable. And, uh, [YOURLEADERNAME], Most Awesome And Terrifying, we.. uh.. might need to put off declarations of war if our populace is unhappy, for similar reas-OUCH!||I deserved that.</Details>

      <Description>Send better representatives to other races.</Description>
      <Details>There is no question that the best diplomacy is the business end of a pulse rifle pointed at your enemies' tender bits. On occasion, if there are insufficient pulse rifles available, we need to convince another species that we don't actually want to enslave them, at least not right this minute. That's where diplomacy comes into play. But because of our history and our combative nature, it's not our strong suit.||Though we hate to admit it, there are sometimes individuals born among our people that are cursed with mild appearance and demeanor. Normally, they don't survive their first decade of life. However, if we cull such wastes of flesh from the general population, and perhaps torture them a little to break them down even further, they can actually appear believably harmless and docile to our enemies! Those "lucky" citizens are our new generation of ambassadors. The galaxy has never seen smooth talkers quite like this!||As a side benefit, the genetic monitoring we developed to catch such individuals before they're killed by their siblings has led to breeding refinements in our administrative slavelings, improving their productivity and our economy further.</Details>

      <Description>More and cheaper slavelings!</Description>
      <Details>Although our administrative slavelings have many of the traits we need, their lifespans are short and they cannot naturally reproduce. We tried getting more out of them by increasing their intelligence, but couldn't manage that without decreasing their empathic ability. We tried extending their lifespans, but they just got senile faster. Finally, we threw in the towel and just started investigating ways of making more of them. Lots more.||With our new hyper-incubation chambers, administrative slavelings are now cheap and plentiful. We've even put some of them to work on the diplomatic front, helping our ambassadors figure out the best ways to confuse and manipulate our enemies. It's a win all around!</Details>
