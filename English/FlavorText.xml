				<Text>The wonderful [PLANETNAME] has long been held in high honor amongst the human race, but only after reaching full enlightenment did it's citizens feel a true connection between themselves and their homeworld. Citizens not living on [PLANETNAME] plan yearly pilgrimages to the revered planet, while humans lucky enough to reside on [PLANETNAME] are continuously advancing the studies and teachings of Terran History. Through government grants, public contributions, and countless volunteer hours, humans on [PLANETNAME] work tirelessly so no citizen of the [EMPIRENAME] forgets where they came from, or what planet they can always call 'Home'.</Text>

				<Text>Mother [PLANETNAME] - the starting point of human galactic expansion. While even the earliest homo-sapiens held an interest in the heavens, it wasn't until 20th century space programs that the human race got a taste of what lay beyond the clouds. Then, following a series of communications with the Arcean Empire, development began on interstellar travel through space-folding mechanisms called 'Star-Gates'. After further research and leaps in the miniaturization of the technology, Hyperdrive propulsion became a reality and a race for the stars began.
				Now, with the [EMPIRENAME] quickly expanding it's borders, only planet [PLANETNAME] will be revered as the humanity's first home.</Text>

				<Text>Once the esteemed homeworld of the human race, [PLANETNAME] has now begun to mirror the evil ways of the now vile [EMPIRENAME]. With little respect for life, and focusing only on expanding [LEADERHISHER] galactic control, [LEADERNAME] has let [PLANETNAME] fall between the cracks of imperial bureaucracy. Once holding a special place in the hearts of all humans, [PLANETNAME] has become 'just another planet' in the eyes of the [EMPIRENAME].</Text>

Even the humble Torian populace was under [SHORTEMPIRENAME] rule until (they have only recently broken free).

				For thousands of years the [SHORTEMPIRENAME] warrior race had dreams of freeing the galaxy of evil. The notion that beings like the Drengin roamed free to subjugate others was unacceptable to them.

				For thousands of years the ancient warrior civilization known as the [SHORTEMPIRENAME]s have wanted to test their mettle against the other civilizations. This desire was held in check because any invasion fleet could be stopped by turning of the stargate.
				Then contact was made with a young civilization, who called themselves humans. A plan was hatched to provide the humans schematics for a stargate that could not be disabled. However, an unexpected boon was gained from this decision. The clever humans created an engine that could bend space and shared the schematics with every race in known space.
				Now the [EMPIRENAME], under the guidance of [LEADERNAME], can finally fulfill its desire to test its strength with anyone foolish enough to grant them the opportunity.

				For thousands of years the [SHORTEMPIRENAME] warrior race had travelled space, but dreams of galactic domination were held back by a single functionality of the stargates: an off switch.
				Providing the humans with plans for a stargate that could not be disabled was to be the [SHORTEMPIRENAME] first true taste of an invasion. However, the crafty humans noticed this and instead used the stargate technology with their own fusion generations to create Hyperdrive and shared it with every civilization in the galaxy.
				Having long ditched notions of honor and justice, the [EMPIRENAME] are now venturing out to test their strength.

				For thousands of years the [SHORTEMPIRENAME] were enslaved by the Drengin. But the Drengin unwittingly educated the [SHORTEMPIRENAME] in the ways of modern civilization which has one simple tenet: money rules everything. By destroying as much property as possible the [SHORTEMPIRENAME]s eventually made it economically impractical for the Drengin to stay, forcing them to leave.
