				<Text>So you have decided to remain. This quadrant will be your death bed, [YourLeaderName].

#You risk much for such a small section of the galaxy... or are you here for more than the expansion of your puny empire? Either way, your destruction is all you will find here.

#We will hold Ixith and drive you from this quadrant, filthy human. Your death awaits.

#Our forces stand strong as your's falter and die. I told you humans were too weak for this quadrant of space. But did you listen to me? Oh, no. You knew it all, didn't you?</Text>

				<Text>Ixith will not fall easily, human.

#Your forces may be strong in this quadrant, but we will hold Ixith without fail.

#Ah, [YourLeaderName]. Intruding on my trade screen like you intruded into this quadrant. Make it quick, human.

#Your persistence is honorable, human, but you will never take the Drengin world of Ixith.</Text>
