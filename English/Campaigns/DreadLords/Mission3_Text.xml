				<Text>You're very persistent, [YourLeaderName]. But, you're also too late. We've recovered the Precursor object and have troops scouring Karion to find the lost Arnorian temple. Soon we will release the power of the Precursors... a power that we will wield to take over the galaxy.


Enjoy your last days, human.</Text>

				<Text>The darkness spreads, [YourLeaderName]. We will soon be stronger than any mortal force... give up while you still can.

#Your forces are weak and frightened, human. With the power of the Precursors within our grasp, you have little hope to cling to.

Do you come to beg for mercy?

#Your lifeforce weakens, [YourLeaderName], and my troops are getting closer to finding the Arnorian Temple. Have you come begging for the mercy of [TheirLeaderName]?</Text>
